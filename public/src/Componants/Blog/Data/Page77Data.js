<b>The Role of Intuition in Marketing</b>
<br><br>
Intuition offers a human touch to marketing decisions, complementing data-driven insights. It fuels creativity and innovation, essential for crafting engaging campaigns. Gut feel and experience contribute valuable perspectives to decision-making, often leading to successful outcomes.

Achieving success in marketing requires striking a balance between data and intuition. A hybrid approach integrates both methods, leveraging data insights while honoring intuition's role. A/B testing serves as a bridge between data-driven and intuition-based decision-making, allowing businesses to validate ideas effectively. Moreover, consumer insights and feedback validate decisions, ensuring alignment with customer needs and preferences.
