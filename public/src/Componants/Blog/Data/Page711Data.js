    In today's business landscape, branding and corporate social responsibility (CSR) are no longer separate entities; they have become intricately linked. Companies are recognizing that their brand is not just a logo or a tagline but a reflection of their values and actions. This article delves into the intersection of branding and CSR, exploring how companies can effectively integrate social responsibility into their brand strategy to create a positive impact and build lasting relationships with their stakeholders.
    <br>
    <b>The Evolution of Branding and CSR</b>
    <br>
    Traditionally, branding focused on creating a unique identity and image for a company, aiming to differentiate it from competitors. CSR, on the other hand, was often seen as a separate effort, focusing on a company's ethical obligations and contributions to society. However, as consumers become more conscious of social and environmental issues, they increasingly expect brands to reflect their values and demonstrate genuine commitment to CSR.
